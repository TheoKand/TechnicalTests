# SalaryFinance Interview Assignment
An assignment given to me during the interview process with UK company SalaryFinance.

Starship Captain Challenge
--------------------------
You are the captain of a starship. You have been tasked with finding the 10
closest habitable planets to your home world and colonizing them.
Your home world is located at these coordinates:
123.123.99.1 X & 098.098.11.1 Y & 456.456.99.9 Z
Your coordinate system ranges from 000.000.00.0 to 999.999.99.9
1. Design and code an algorithm to randomly generate 15,000 coordinates. Each
of these coordinates must be randomly marked as a planet or a very hungry
space monster. (Space monsters eat starships and should be avoided at all
costs)
- Each of these coordinates marked as a planet must be randomly
marked as habitable or not.
- Each Habitable planet must have a surface area randomly ranging from
1 million to 100 million square kilometers.
- Due to the strange construction of the star system you live in, travel
time between any planet and its immediate neighbor is always 10
minutes
Write the results to a .txt file in a format of your choosing.
2. Design and code an algorithm to read the file created in step 1 which will
identify the planets you have to travel to and colonize to achieve the largest
amount of colonized space within a 24-hour period.
- In order to inhabit a planet, you have to colonize more than 50% of its
surface.
- Colonization takes place at exactly 0.43 seconds per square kilometer.
Give an explanation of your thought processes used to solve the problem and
clearly state any assumptions made – these should be done through comments in
the code.
Complete your solution in a Visual Studio project using the C#, VB.NET or
JavaScript programming language. If you do not have Visual Studio you can
download the community edition for free from the Internet.
Solutions coded completely in SQL will also be accepted, the file writing and
reading component can be replaced with the use of a temp table. Please note that
the script must be able to run against any database (i.e. must not use any
schema of the database itself, but only temporary database structures). Again,
SQL Express can be downloaded for free from the Internet.
PLEASE NOTE:
1) Make sure you read and understand the challenge 100% before you do
any coding.
2) Good design will be valued more than absolute output correctness.
3) Code efficiency is important.
4) Comment your code!
5) If you don’t understand part of the challenge, read it again. If you still do
not understand, please feel free to send us any questions.
6) Have fun!


Loan Comparison Tool
--------------------

Online demo: http://theokand.com/SalaryFinanceInterviewAssignment/

Take a look at our website www.salaryfinance.com, you are going to build a loan
comparison tool using JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net).
Create an interface to compare credit card debt and a SalaryFinance Loan.
The user interface needs to capture:
- Credit Card balance
- Credit Card APR
- Monthly Repayment Amount
On a button click, the UI should display:
- Number of months remaining to pay off the Credit Card debt and the total
amount that will be repaid.
- Details of a SalaryFinance loan (at 7.9% APR), including monthly
repayment amount, total repayment amount, and length of term.
- Explain to the user how much better off they will be by having a
SalaryFinance Loan.
Feel free to play with design and or provide other supplement materials to
communicate this. Clearly state any assumptions made – these can be done
through comments in the code.
PLEASE NOTE:
1) The UI should be intuitive, albeit simple.
2) Output correctness is important.
3) Code efficiency is important.
4) Comment your code!
5) Have fun!
