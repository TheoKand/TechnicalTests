SedolValidator.Core
===================

This is a class library project that contains the interfaces and the concrete classes for the validator and validationresult.


SedolValidator.Tests
====================

This is a class library project that contains the unit tests that implement the provided scenarios. It references SedolValidator.Core 
and NUnit. You can run the tests in Visual Studio via the menu Test>Run>All Tests.

The solution was created with Visual Studio 2017.

I have excluded the bin/obj folders as well as the packages folder. The required packages should be downloaded automatically by Visual
Studio once you build the project.
